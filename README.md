# Health data standards

### Emerging
1. [MeDevIS](https://medevis.who-healthtechnologies.org/) <br>
Launched by WHO to provide information on 2301 product categories, including communications software, laboratory information systems, and image archiving systems.
The platform is intended to assist governments, regulators, and users in making informed decisions regarding selection, procurement, and reimbursement of these tools.
MedevIS also aims to simplify the coding of medical devices. It includes both the European Medical Device Nomenclature (EMDN) and the Global Medical Device Nomenclature (GMDN), which is used by regulatory agencies in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the USA. MedevIS can replace paper-based literature searches across multiple publications with non-standard device names. The naming systems include coding and definitions and can be used in every country to facilitate registration for regulatory approval, procurement and supply, inventories in health facilities, tracking and pricing. Devices and technologies are categorised according to coding, level of health care systems to support the device, scope of the device, and infrastructure required, among other categories.
